```
git clone https://github.com/harshal-limaye/protractor-cucumber-typescript.git
```

## Reports
This project uses [Cucumber HTML Reporter](https://github.com/gkushang/cucumber-html-reporter) package to generate reports. It generates a two files report.json and report.html at the root of this repository each time ```npm test``` command is fired.

You can change the report file names and there locations by simply updating configuration object passed to ***reporter.generate*** method inside config.ts file located inside config folder.

## Notes

```
capabilities: {
    browserName: "chrome"
}
```
